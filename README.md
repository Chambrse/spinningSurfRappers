Project #2


## Hi Teammates!

To get started, clone the repo, run npm install. Then, create a local database and table using the db sql seed files. make sure you change your username and password in the config.json file in the development object.

The master branch of the repo is protected and is our "live" branch. When we merge a pull request to this branch, heroku automatically updates and restarts the server. I've also created a development branch and a branch for each of us under our first names. When you clone the repo, run git fetch and git checkout <your first name> to switch to your branch. It is my suggestion that we all push only to our own branches and use pull requests to merge our changes into the development branch, and then to the master branch. Don't forget to pull from the dev branch before doing a pull request.

I've got express, handlebars, sequelize, heroku, and jawsDB working with the appropriate file structure and a test database. The index.hbr file imports a reset.css file, the style.css file, the client.js file, jquery, and bootstrap.
